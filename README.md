# Summary :sunglasses:

In common bleeding edge securty resarch applications like Symbolic Execution,
people are inhibited by their abilities to process and parse complex
architectures like x86. With this solution, we use modern web development
processes and machine learning to solve those problems and get expressions
from common machine code. Since machine learning is used here, it can be
scaled out to deploy these security solutions to many problems in the industry.
Providing radical change.

# Linux

This project leverages the power of the Linux kernel for much of the
dependencies, thus I have included it as a submodule. This is part of my
outreach to support the open-source community and expand on the shoulders
of giants!

# Solutions used :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

- Machine learning :volcano:
- Rust :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart:
- Modern HTML :cyclone:
- High-performance string parsing :zap:
- Complex image compression :scream_cat:
- JSON and well-structured serialization and deserialization :pray:
